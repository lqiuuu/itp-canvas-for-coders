## Idea statements examples
```
Eyes gazing at you without intent.
```

```
Sometimes I imagine myself in an infinite room, completely isolated from the outside world.
In that space, only vast thoughts exist, and it would take million years to reach the edge.
```

```
A recently deceased man returns as a ghost to his suburban home to console his bereft wife,
only to find that in his spectral state, he has become stuck in time,
forced to watch passively as the life he knew and the woman he loves slowly slip away.

- A Ghost Story
```

```
Treat the Earth well: it was not given to you by your parents, it was loaned to you by your children.

â€“ Ancient Kenyan proverb
```

```
Are we alone?
```
